Extract a dataset containing the following information about the managers: employee number, first name, and last name.
Add two columns at the end â€“ one showing the difference between the maximum and minimum salary of that employee,
and another one saying whether this salary raise was higher than $30,000 or NOT.

If possible, provide more than one solution.
